# Disease Image Classification with CNN:  Revolutionizing Diagnosis

**Empowering healthcare with AI:  Early, accurate disease detection from medical images.**

This project tackles a critical challenge in healthcare:  rapid and reliable disease diagnosis. We've developed a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model that analyzes medical images to predict diseases like Pneumonia, COVID, Arthritis, and Alzheimer's.  

**Why This Matters:**

* **Early Detection:** Timely diagnosis leads to better treatment outcomes and improves patient care.
* **Accessibility:** AI-powered solutions can make diagnostic expertise more readily available, even in remote areas.
* **Efficiency:**  Automated image analysis streamlines the diagnostic process, saving time and resources.

**Technical Highlights:**

* **Model:** A custom CNN architecture was designed and implemented from scratch, tailored specifically for medical image classification. 
   
* **Dataset:**  A wide range of medical image datasets were used for training and validation, ensuring robust performance across diverse image types and disease categories. 

* **Performance:**
    *  **Accuracy:** 93.7%
    *  **Precision:** 92.1%
    *  **F1-Score:** 93.3%

**Deployment:**

* **API:**  A RESTful API was developed to provide access to the model for predictions. 
* **Streamlit Web App:**  A user-friendly web app (powered by Streamlit) allows for image upload and disease classification.
